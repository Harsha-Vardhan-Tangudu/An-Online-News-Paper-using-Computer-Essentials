## Introduction

The introduction section provides an overview of the online newspaper application and its features. It explains that an online newspaper is the digital version of a newspaper, offering more elaborate content and easy access to old issues.

## Type of Application

This section discusses the two types of applications developed for the online newspaper: mobile application and web application. It highlights the benefits of each type and the target users.

## Operating System for the Application

The operating system for each application is specified in this section. The mobile application uses Android as the operating system, while the web application uses Windows.

## Database Design and Queries for the Application

The database design and queries section describes the database management system used for the application. It introduces various types of databases and presents the entity-relationship (ER) model schema for the online newspaper application. Additionally, it provides example DDL and DML queries for creating, modifying, and retrieving data from the database.

## Networking Model for the Application

This section explains the networking model chosen for the online newspaper application. It discusses the concept of network topology and specifies the use of the mesh topology. The advantages and disadvantages of mesh topology are mentioned, along with the client-server model and network protocols used.

## Summary

The summary section provides a brief overview of the key points covered in the project, including the platforms used, estimated cost, SQL queries, ER diagram, networking topology, and marketing strategies.

## References

The references section lists the sources consulted during the project, including websites, blogs, and tutorials.
